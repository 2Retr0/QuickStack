# QuickStack
Download the latest version over at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/quickstack)!

Too lazy to spend dozens of hours constructing an automatic item sorter? QuickStack is a mod that aims to provide an intuitive way to deposit your inventory to nearby blocks/entities (following an identically named feature from *Terraria*)! This mod also provides further quality-of-life features than one may expect—specifically...

## Features
![Quick Stack Demo](https://github.com/2Retr0/QuickStack/raw/HEAD/.assets/quickstack_demo.gif "Quick Stack Demo")  
**Quick Stacking Items!** (obviously) *(Clicking on a new button within your inventory will dump items into related containers!)*
* Items are *only* stacked into containers which already contain the item. If multiple containers are present, containers are prioritized based on how much of the item they hold.
    * By default, only non-hotbar inventory items will be considered for quick stacking (configurable).
    * Upon completion, an informational toast containing the summary of the quick stack will display cycling through deposited items and their destination containers.
- ❓*Note: A hybrid pathfinding/line-of-sight check is made to prevent stacking items to inaccessible containers (for balancing).*

![Color Coordination Demo](https://github.com/2Retr0/QuickStack/raw/HEAD/.assets/quickstack_demo_color.gif "Color Coordination Demo")  
**Color-coordinated mappings!** *(Upon initiating a quick stack, slots will be highlighted with colors that correspond to their respective destination block/entity highlight color!)*
* Each unique destination container (per quick stack) will be highlighted a different color to help communicate where each item goes.
- The duration for how long slots/destinations are highlighted (configurable) only begins when the inventory screen is closed giving an opportunity to read mappings.
---  
![Entity Quick Stack Demo](https://github.com/2Retr0/QuickStack/raw/HEAD/.assets/quickstack_demo_entity.gif "Entity Quick Stack Demo")  
**Support for quick stacking into entities!** *(Any entity, which contains an accessible inventory, can have items deposited into it!)*
* This includes—but is not limited to—llamas, donkeys, chest boats, and chest minecarts!
- ❓*Note: If the entity happens to already be glowing, the additional highlight will not interfere with the potion effect properties (duration, etc.). Only the color will be altered for the period the highlight is present!*
---  
![Favorite Item Demo](https://github.com/2Retr0/QuickStack/raw/HEAD/.assets/quickstack_demo_favorite.gif "Favorite Item Demo")  
**Marking items as favorites to prevent accidental stacking!** *(Another mod of mine, [ItemFavorites](https://modrinth.com/mod/itemfavorites), comes* ***prepackaged*** *in this mod, integrating all the functionality from it!)*
* The *ItemFavorites* mod also includes other functionality for items marked as favorites—check the related [mod page](https://modrinth.com/mod/itemfavorites) to learn more!
- ❗*Note: Items can be marked as favorites by clicking on them while* ***holding the left `alt` key*** *(configurable).*
- ❗*Note: As *ItemFavorites* is bundled in, you need not download (and can remove it) if you install this mod!*
